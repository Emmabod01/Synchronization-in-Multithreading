# Synchronization-in-Multithreading

Synchronization in Multithreading concept in Java is simply the capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resources.
Synchronization is used to prevent thread interference or inconsistency in access to shared resources.

The program shows thread t1 (with value 5 being passed) and t2 (with value 100 being passed). At the running state of both threads, the result shows that t2 accessed the resources after t1 finished its execution. Hence, consistency in multithreading.
